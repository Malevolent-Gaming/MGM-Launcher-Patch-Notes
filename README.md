# Malevolent Gaming News

## Launcher is officially "Launched!" - Pun intended
### We have officially finshed our multi game launcher!
This launcher will take care of installing and updating all of our MMO server clients and future updates.

## Launcher Features
- See the server status in the top right corner
- Change your client settings, install path and repair by selecting the **"Settings"** button on each game page
- View the latest update notes directly on the launcher for each game
- Stay up to day with **Malevolent News** on the main page


### A HUGE thank you to Mannax for spending a TON of time with me working on this launcher. Please note, if anything breaks, its his fault!
If you DO have an issue with the launcher, be sure to submit a ticket on our **Launcher-Support** channel on Discord!
